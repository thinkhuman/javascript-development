# Arrays

An array is a _data structure_--in practical terms, a special variable--used to store multiple values (of any type). It looks like this:

```
var things = [ "Dog", "Cat", "Salamander", 42, 12+12, 945.55, true ];
```

In JavaScript, an array is an _object_. Arrays in JavaScript are ordered, meaning the positions of values in an array value do not change (unless you change them).
