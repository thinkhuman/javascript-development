# Scope

In JavaScript, _scope_ is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.

Most popular languages use *block* scope--a variable is defined in a block, and its scope is limited to that block unless you modify it.

JavaScript has _function_ scope--a variable's scope is the function it was created in. 

Understanding scope is critical to working with JavaScript, because much of JavaScript programming is concerned with defining and manipulating scope.
