# Data Types

Data types are a way to classify data so a compiler or interpreter know how to efficiently store the data and display desired results.

JavaScript has six data types--five primitives, and the object data type:

* **Boolean**: True, False
* **Object**: {} (object literal), or new Object()
* **Undefined**: declared, but has no assigned value (like an empty variable)
* **Null**: An assignment value. Used to indicate "no value". `typeof(null)` returns "object", but this is a long-standing JS error.
* **Number**: 1, 1.0
* **String**" 'a', "a"

A helpful mnemonic to remember these is BOUNNS. 

JS is *dynamically* typed, meaning data type is not predefined, but instead determined on the fly based on the currently assigned value. *Statically* typed means data type is set in advance. Languages like Java use static typing.

Use typeof() to check type of a data type.
