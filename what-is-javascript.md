# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.

JavaScript helps make web pages dynamic. It can create interactivity, cause dynamic changes, and collect and display data. In other words, JavaScript affects the functionality and display of web pages.

Using libraries and frameworks, JavaScript can also create a web *application* that works just like a desktop application, but in the browser. To do this, it connects to and manipulates the DOM, which is part of every web page. JavaScript gets/sets/changes/affects DOM elements through built-in (or custom-defined) methods, like `.getElementByID`. 

JavaScript has a similar syntax to C, PHP, and Java, though this is less true in the latest versions (ES6). The fundamental difference between JS and these languages is how it creates and interacts with _objects_. More on those later.
