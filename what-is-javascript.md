# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, interpreted programming language.

JavaScript affects the functionality and display of web pages, and helps make them dynamic. It can create interactivity, cause dynamic changes, and collect and display data.

Using libraries and frameworks, JavaScript can also create a web *application* that works just like a desktop application, but in the browser. To do this, it connects to and manipulates the _DOM_ (Document Object Model), which is part of every web page. JavaScript interacts with DOM elements through built-in (or custom-defined) methods, like `.getElementByID`. 

JavaScript has a similar syntax to C, PHP, and Java, though this is less true in the latest versions (ES6). The fundamental difference between JS and these languages is how it creates and interacts with _objects_. More on those later.
